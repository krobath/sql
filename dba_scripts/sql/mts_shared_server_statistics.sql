-- |            statistics.                                                     |

-- |            SERVERS_STARTED    : The number of shared server processes      |
-- |                                 started as the instance adjusts the number |
-- |                                 of shared processes up and down from the   |
-- |                                 initial value specified by the MTS_SERVERS |
-- |                                 parameter. When the instance starts, and   |
-- |                                 after the initial number of shared server  |
-- |                                 processes processes specified by           |
-- |                                 MTS_SERVERS has been started, this value   |
-- |                                 is set to 0. From that point on, this      |
-- |                                 value is incremented whenever a new shared |
-- |                                 server process is started.                 |
-- |            SERVERS_TERMINATED : A count of the total number of shared      |
-- |                                 server processes that have been terminated |
-- |                                 since the instance was started.            |
-- |            SERVERS_HIGHWATER  : The maximum number of shared server        |
-- |                                 processes that have ever been running at   |
-- |                                 one moment in time.                        |
-- |                                                                            |
-- |            NOTES: If the SERVERS_HIGHWATER value matches, the instance's   |
-- |                   MTS_MAX_SERVERS value, then you might realize a          |
-- |                   performance benefit from increasing MTS_MAX_SERVERS. If  |
-- |                   the counts for SERVERS_STARTED and SERVERS_TERMINATED    |
-- |                   keep climbing, then you should consider raising          |
-- |                   MTS_SERVERS. Raising the minimum number of shared server |
-- |                   processes should reduce the number that are deleted only |
-- |                   to be recreated later.                                   |
-- |                                                                            |
