# | PURPOSE    : This script is part of a larger disaster recovery plan and    |
# |              executes the tasks responsible to FAILOVER a physical standby |
# |              database to make it the primary database in a Data Guard      |
# |              configuration. A failover implies that the primary database   |
# |              is unavailable and that there is no possibility of restoring  |
# |              it to a service within a reasonable amount of time. Depending |
# |              on the protection mode, the possibility of data loss exists.  |
# |                                                                            |
# |              This script can be used on a physical standby database        |
# |              regardless of its protection mode - maximum performance,      |
# |              maximum availability, or maximum protection. Prompts are      |
# |              provided throughout this script to walk the DBA through the   |
# |              role transition process and providing him/her with a clear    |
# |              understanding of the consequences involved when performing a  |
# |              failover operation.                                           |
# |                                                                            |
# |              Anyone executing this script should have a clear              |
# |              understanding of the outcome after performing a failover      |
# |              operation.                                                    |
